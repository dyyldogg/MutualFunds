            As the world recovers from Covid-19 effects, many industries are returning to their pre-pandemic prosperity, including airlines. Due to the dramatically decreased demands for pilots within the last 18 months, many airlines provided massive retirement incentives to limit their costs. The effects of mass retirement are exacerbated by the fact that the US enforces mandatory retirement for pilots that are over the age of 65 for safety purposes. Although this may not seem like an issue, “Due to demographic factors and the history of the U.S. airline industry's growth, a huge number of pilots will turn 65 during the 2020s” (Levine-Weinburg). The again workforce puts the airline industry in distress; however, it is important to understand that the airline industry would be in a shortage for pilots this decade regardless of the pandemic’s effects, but the coexistence of these two factors puts the aviation industry in desperation.
          </p>

          <p style="line-height: 2;">As travel regulations have loosened, more people are allowed on commercial flights, increasing the demand for pilots. This dramatic demand requires a proportionate increase in supply which the United States can not provide under current circumstances. There are a few solutions that the United States might look towards. Firstly, there might be a temporary halt on the retirement age in the commercial sector to stimulate a surge in pilot recruitments. However, even if thousands more pilots are recruited in the coming years than previous years, the training process would take thousands more hours of flight experience. Even military-trained pilots would be unequipped to take roles in the commercial sector since private training takes longer. 
          </p>
         

          <p style="line-height: 2;">Although airline companies like Delta have added hundreds of pilots in the past few months, their efforts may be too late. Pre-pandemic capacity levels discouraged airline companies from recruiting during the pandemic, leaving only months to quickly replace the pilots. Some have even been disinentived from taking such a job course as the “industry's deep downturn last year may have scared away some aspiring pilots, thinning out the pipeline of future pilots” (Levine-Weinburg). Needless to say, recruiting pilots during the upcoming decade will be a demanding task even if mandated regulations for becoming a pilot are decreased. 

          </p>

          <p style="line-height: 2;">Despite the impacts on the aviation industry as a whole, certain sectors of the pipeline have been and will continue to be more drastically affected. Regional carriers, for example, are having a much more difficult time recruiting pilots compared to low-cost carriers. As detailed by Geoff Murray, partner on Oliver Wyman’s global aerospace sector team, “83 percent of regional carriers [are] finding it challenging to recruit talent compared with 22 percent of low-cost carriers,” creating a disparity of almost 4 times between these different sectors (Murrary). Consequently, regional sectors may take years to recover from the pandemic’s effects that transpired in just months.

          <p style="line-height: 2;">The aviation industry of all nations has been damaged to all extents by the pandemic, yet the United States is burdened with a uniquely aging task force and many commercial and private sectors to balance. As the problem seems to have no end, the solution will be gradual. Currently, the vital task is to increase the magnitude of pilots quickly. Many more incentives are in position to be passed as legislation, such as increased salaries and a more direct path to certification. The aviation industry will face an uphill battle in the coming months, but airline recovery will call upon immediate action.
