          <p>Investing is a great way to let your money work for you while you are busy doing other things; this is called passive income. Investor Warren Buffet defines investing as “the process of laying out money now to receive more money in the future.” You can invest in bonds, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, real estate, commodities, etc.; however, this article will explore how a teenager, or a beginner, should get started investing in stocks and why it is beneficial for their future. 
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Well, what exactly is a stock anyways?</h2>

          <p>A stock is a <mark>share of ownership in a company</mark>. Some people buy and sell stocks quickly over the course of a couple of hours, days, weeks, or months—people who do this are called day traders. However, given the context of this article, I believe teenagers or anyone who is less experienced with investing in stocks and are looking for less risk should buy stocks and hold them for many years—these people are called investors.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Where can I buy a stock?</h2>

          <p>Stocks are usually bought and sold on <mark>stock exchanges</mark>, which is a place where buyers and sellers exchange their shares for money or their money for shares. As an individual, you cannot trade directly on a stock exchange; you will need a brokerage account, which acts as the “middleman” that gives people access to a stock exchange. In the United States, well-known brokers include <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tdameritrade.com/home.page">TD Ameritrade</a>,
             <a   target="_blank" href="https://www.schwab.com/trading/software">Charles Schwab</a>,
              <a target="_blank" href="https://www.fidelity.com/">Fidelity</a>, 
              <a target="_blank" href="https://us.etrade.com/home">E*Trade</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://robinhood.com/">Robinhood</a>, and 
              <a target="_blank" href="https://www.webull.com/">Webull</a>. All of these reputable brokerages have an amazing user interface and make it really easy for beginners to start investing. If you are under 18, a parent or guardian has to open a custodial account and deposit the funds. Once these funds are transferred, you can begin investing the money with your parents executing the trades. 
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">How can I place an order for a stock?</h2>

          <p>The two major types of orders that every investor should know are the <mark>market order</mark> and the <mark>limit order</mark>. A market order is the most basic type of trade, where you can buy or sell immediately at the current price or anywhere near what the stock is trading at. In fast-moving and volatile markets and illiquid stocks <em>(which I recommend as a beginner to stay away from)</em>, the price at which you actually execute the trade can deviate from the last traded price; basically, market orders don’t guarantee a price, but they do guarantee the order’s execution. A limit order allows investors to buy and sell securities at a certain price in the future, so this type of order executes a trade if the price reaches the price you specify. There are some more advanced types of stock orders (stop-loss order, stop-limit order, AON, IOC, FOK, GTC, day, and take profit); however, I recommend as a beginner to stick to market or limit orders.
