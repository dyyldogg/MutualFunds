          <p style="font-family:'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size: 1.5em;">"Give them a choice of gold and wisdom—what do they do? Ignore the wisdom and waste the gold. On the morrow they wail because they have no more gold. <br><br> Gold is reserved for those who know its laws and abide by them."</p>


          

          <p style="line-height: 2;">
            George S. Clason’s The Richest Man in Babylon, frequentailly abbreviated as Babylon, could most accurately fit the definition of <strong>“the true bible of wealth”</strong> as it presents itself as a collection of parables set over 4,000 years ago. Babylon draws exceptional similarities to the Holy Bible’s utilization of metaphors, symbols, and allegories in order to convey a powerful message while simultaneously avoiding mentioning specific niches or economical situations for the greater purpose of establishing itself as a timeless classic. As expected, Clason’s efforts of making a timeless novel have been proven valid as the self-help parable is still widely read today despite it nearing its 100 year anniversary since publication.
          </p>

          <p style="line-height: 2;">
            Babylon has a lot of useful lessons to offer <i>(which it seems overly self-aware of, noting the </i><span style="font-family:'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size: 1.0em;">“THE SUCCESS SECRETS OF THE ANCIENTS - THE MOST INSPIRING BOOK ON WEALTH EVER WRITTEN”</span> <i>printed on the front cover)</i>. Although its broad themes and archaic language prevent it from falling out of public favor in a rapidly evolving “politically correct” society <i>(a problem which Napoleon Hill’s Think and Grow Rich is facing due to its underlying of misogyny, among other things)</i>, Babylon falls short through the fact that it is an extremely difficult read. Babylon is scattered with hidden meanings, complicated allegories, and painfully biblical-esque word usage <i>(e.g.,“make thy gold multiply”, “seven curses for a lean purse”, “thereby shalt thou acquire confidence in thy self to achieve thy carefully desires”)</i>
 
          </p>

          <p style="line-height: 2;">
            A thorough reading and proper annotation of Babylon can take several hours. This article is going to summarize, simplify, and illustrate the key lessons from George Clarson’s masterpiece.
          </p>

          <h2 style="font-family: 'Brygada 1918', serif;!important" class="section-heading">The Man Who Desired Gold <br><span style="font-size: .5em;"><i>The characteristics that keep the lower class poor; the ideological difference between the Rich and the Poor (growth vs. fixed mindset)</i><span>
          </h2>
          <p style="line-height: 2;">
            <i>Babylon</i> begins first by telling the prerequisite story of how two common men met and heard the story of Arkad, the richest man in Babylon. Comparing themselves to him, the two men complain of their unfavorable financial situation alongside their discomfort in the labor of their current jobs:
          </p>

            <ul><i>“Perhaps there is some secret we might learn if we sought it from those who knew … I wish an income that will keep flowing into my purse whether I sit upon the wall or travel to far lands”</i></ul>

          <p style="line-height: 2;">
            Clason in this chapter first discusses the lack of financial literacy. In the beginning, two friends complain to each other that they are unsure what “secrets” the ultra rich hold in order to become successful. The two men realize the wealth discrepancy between themselves and the elite class in Babylon, but resort to complaining rather than taking incentive to find success.
          </p>

          <p style="line-height: 2;">
          Key lessons:
          <br>
          <ol>
          <li>Having a poor mindset results in living a poor life, optimism and education are the only ways to change your situation. A poor life with a job you hate just to survive is no better than enslavement. <br><span style="font-size: .9em"><i>“Yet, thou dost make me see how little better off are we, free men” (6)</i></span></li>
          
          <br>
          
          <li>In society, there will always be potential to capitalize. <br><span style="font-size: .9em"><i>“Are we more than dumb sheep? We live in the richest city in the world.” (5)</i></span></li>

          <br>

          <li>Desires and daydreaming, “wishes”, will get you nowhere if you never act upon them. <br><span style="font-size: .9em"><i>“I wish to own lands and cattle, to have fine robes and coins in my purse.” (7)</i></span></li>


          
          </ol>
          
          


          <h2 style="font-family: 'Brygada 1918', serif;!important" class="section-heading">The Richest Man in Babylon
          </h2>

          <p style="line-height: 2;">A well respected and renowned man, Arkad, titled the “Richest Man in Babylon” runs into some old friends from his childhood. They recognize him, but are dumbfounded at the fact that their childhood friend, who they had viewed as trivial, had become so successful. They urgently ask him about his story and advice, and Arkad proceeds to tell the methods of his wealth.
          </p>

          <!-- <p style="font-family:'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size: 1.5em;">“Fate leads the willing, and drags along the reluctant.”
            - Seneca, <i>Letters from a Stoic</i>
        </p> -->

        <ul>
          
          <li>Arkad explained that he was no wiser, nor stronger than either of the men, evening revealing he is actually below average compared to them. <br><span style="font-size: .9em"><i>“Once we were equal. We studied under the same master and played the same games … neither did you outshine us.” (9) [an allusion to insignificance of academic or athletic performance in relation to success]</i></span></li><br>

          <li>He states that all the men from their childhood who had inherited wealth lacked good habits and financial literacy and were unable to manage their assets, resulting in them becoming bankrupt.  <br><span style="font-size: .9em"><i>“On the contrary, [the goddess of luck] brings ruin to almost every man upon whom she showers unearned gold. She makes wanton spenders, who soon dissipate all they receive and are left beset by overwhelming appetites and desires they have not the ability to gratify. Yet others whom she favors become misers and hoard their wealth, fearing to spend what they have, knowing they do not possess the ability to replace it. They further are beset by fear of robbers and doom themselves to lives of emptiness and secret misery.” (10)
          </i></span></li><br>

          <li>He first stated that he manifested becoming rich.<br><span style="font-size: .9em"><i>“I decided to myself that I would claim my share of the good things of life. I would not be one of those who stand afar off enviously watching others enjoy.” (13)
          </i></span></li><br>
          


          <li>Arkad also understood that success does not come easily nor quickly. His success would take time and preparation. <br><span style="font-size: .9em"><i>“I decided that if I was to achieve what I desired, time and study would be required” (15)
          </i></span></li><br>


          <li>In order to make this goal possible, Arkad understood that he had to educate himself. He quickly figured out you can get most things in life just by asking, and that man fears asking others for guidance because of their low self esteem, anxiety, and laziness. Arkad made use of this fact by asking for an (unpaid) apprenticeship under every successful man he could find in order to learn. </li><br>

          <li>Contrary to many modern nihilistic philosophies, Arkad argues that men have ample amount of time. He explains every man has more than enough time to become wealthy and live a good life. <br><span style="font-size: .9em"><i>“As for time, all men have it in abundance … sufficient time to have made yourselves wealthy.” (18)
          </i></span></li><br>

        </ul>



          <p style="line-height: 2;">Arkad then splits the the rest of the book into four key principles: <strong>The Five Laws of Gold </strong> <i>(the pronounced laws of accumulating wealth)</i>, <strong>The Seven Cures for a Lean Purse</strong> <i>(how to apply the five laws of gold)</i>, <strong>The Goddess Of Good Luck</strong> <i>(luck favors those who don’t procrastinate)</i>, <strong>Gold Lender of Babylon</strong> <i>(how to evaluate your investments)</i>, and <strong>The Camel Trader of Babylon</strong> <i>(escaping unfavorable circumstances)</i>.
          </p>

          <!-- <p style="font-family:'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size: 1.5em;">“Today I escaped from anxiety. Or no, I discarded it, because it was within me, in my own perceptions — not outside."
            - Marcus Aurelius,
            <i>Meditations</i> -->
        <!-- </p>

          <p style="line-height: 2;">The Stoics highly advocate for acting upon logic, rather than letting emotion override your actions. In addition, the school promotes frequent mediating, suggesting that one should constantly be in dialogue with oneself, reflecting upon one’s reality, blessings and the contemplation of death.
          </p>

          <p style="line-height: 2;">Furthermore, the Stoics preach that a simple method of achieving happiness is found through the relinquishment of material goods. Through practicing Asceticism <i>(voluntary abstinence from material goods and worldly pleasures)</i>, one will finally observe the surrounding world clearly, allowing them to become present in the current moment. They explain that <mark>once you are able to find happiness without relying on material pleasures, you will be free from suffering, which the Stoics believe to be the ultimate goal of life.</mark>

          <br><h2 style="font-family: 'Brygada 1918', serif; text-align: center;">The Five Laws of Gold
          </h2>
          <!-- TRY TO CENTER THESE -->

          <br><p style="text-align: center;">Law I</p>
          <div style="border: 1px solid black;
          border-collapse: collapse;   padding: 20px;
          border-spacing: 5px;  border-right: 1px solid;"> 

          <table style="width:100%; text-align: center;">            
            <tr>
              <th>Literal text</th>
              <th>Simplification</th>

            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td> I. Gold cometh gladly and in increasing quantity to any man who will put by not less than one-tenth of his earnings to create an estate for his future and that of his family.</td>
              <td>Wealth accumulates around those who save. One must save (atleast) 10% of all their earnings instantly as they receive their paycheck, before using their earned money to buy anything else</td>
    
          </table></div>

          <p style="text-align: center;"><i>“A part of all I earned was mine to keep”</i></p>

            <ul>
              <li>Definitely the most important lesson from <i>Babylon</i>, Arkad explains that the <strong>most</strong> important rule of accumulation is to always “pay yourself" first before paying others. In simple terms, Arkad is stating that once you get your paycheck, you must allocate a portion <i>(something around 10%)</i> to yourself <i>(your savings accounts & investments)</i>. He explains that it is absurd that the majority of the “sheep” population pays everyone else before paying themselves <i>(paying for food, clothes, entertainment, other material goods).</i><br><span style="font-size: .9em"><i>“Do you not pay the garment- maker? Do you not pay the sandalmaker? Do you not pay for the things you eat? Can you live in Babylon without spending? What have you to show for your earnings of the past mouth? What for the past year? Fool! You pay to everyone but yourself. Dullard, you labor for others. As well be a slave and work for what your master gives you to eat and wear. If you did keep for yourself one-tenth of all you earn, how much would you have in ten years?” (14) 
              </i></span></li><br>
            </ul>  
        

          <br><i style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: 550;">Maintain and Guide Your Time.
        </i>

          <p style="line-height: 2;"><strong>You must accept the fact that your time is your greatest asset.</strong> Time is more valuable than any material asset, and exchanging the majority of your time for material assets is the most regretful decision you'll ever make. Do not let people take advantage of your time, do not waste your time not building to become a better and happier person tomorrow. Always be working on something. As I said, wasting your time will be the most regretful decision you will ever make
          </p>

          <p style="font-family:'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size: 1.5em;">“We’re tight-fisted with property and money, yet think too little of wasting time, the one thing about which we should all be the toughest misers.” — Seneca
        </p>

        <br><i style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: 550;">Develop inner control, develop inner peace
        </i>


          <p style="line-height: 2;">Although you will never be able to control your surrounding circumstances, you must develop inner control of not only your emotions but also what is in your control.
        </p>

        <p style="line-height: 2;">Epictetus, one of the “big three” of Stoic philosophy, was born a slave. However, Epictetus did not have the mind of a slave, he did not let his circumstances affect his emotions. Epictetus understood that while technically his body was not even his property, his mind, emotions, and desires were—
        </p>


          <p style="font-family:'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size: 1.5em;">EPICTETUS UNDERSTOOD THAT HE HAD POWER OVER HIS MIND, NOT HIS CIRCUMSTANCES. THUS, DESPITE LIVING A LIFE FULL OF OBJECTIVE SUFFERING, HE DIED A HAPPY AND CONTENT MAN IN POVERTY.
          </p>


          <br><i style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: 550;">Human interaction and the Ego
        </i>

      

          <!-- ADD A QUOTE <blockquote class="blockquote">The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</blockquote> -->


          <p style="line-height: 2;">While interacting with others, it is important to understand that it costs nothing to be kind to everyone you meet. The Stoics taught that it is important to approach every situation with hospitality. Further, they taught that one should work on having as little opinions as possible. Many people believe that they are much greater than others, and that although they preach learning and reading, they secretly believe that they already know everything. Do not let yourself come to this conclusion. 
          </p>

          <p style="font-family:'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size: 1.5em;">“All I know is that I know nothing” - Socrates
        </p>

        <br><i style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: 550;">Meditation and Journaling
        </i> 
      
          <p style="line-height: 2;">Although I’m nowhere near a meditative master, I try to practice meditation at least everyday before bed, and whenever my emotions are stressing me out. Just as Marcus Aurelius said, meditation allows me to “discard” my anxiety.
          </p>

          <p style="line-height: 2;">Additionally, a simple practice I uphold is journaling every night. Journaling every night has allowed me to not only reflect upon my decisions but determine what parts of my day made me happy and which parts of my day had bothered me, allowing me to identify and change myself upon my observations. Without journaling, I would usually just ignore these thoughts and suffer from very slow character development. Although some nights I find it extremely cumbersome, I am very proud of my 50+ day streak of journaling and I truly believe it has helped me significantly develop as a person.
        </p>

        <br><i style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: 550;">Taking Cold Showers

        </i> 


          <p style="line-height: 2;">Although taking cold showers seems like an oddly specific example compared to the others on this list, it is symbolic for <mark>abstaining from comfort</mark>. Taking a cold shower, especially in the morning, might be the most uncomfortable way to start your day. The Stoics preach that if you abstain from worldly comforts for satisfaction, you will be able to find happiness upon the surface value of life.
          </p>

          <br><br><br>

          <p style="line-height: 2;">There’s a lot we can learn from the great Stoic thinkers of history. Following their ideologies, we can take simple steps to not only becoming happier but also becoming better perceived by others.

          </p>
