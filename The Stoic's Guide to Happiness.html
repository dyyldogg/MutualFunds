          <p style="font-family:'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size: 1em;">“You have power over your mind - not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength” --Marcus Aurelius
          </p>

          <p><i>Picture this:</i> Your name is Zeno and you're from a small town named Citium. You worked hard and sacrificed your early years in order to be successful. The fruits of your labor are bountiful, and now you have amassed a considerable sum of wealth for you and your family. However, your life undergoes a drastic turn of events—once being a wealthy merchant, fate has seemingly screwed you over in a moment's notice. Everything you once owned has been lost in a shipwreck and you are now dirt poor. Essentially being back to square one, you no longer have anything: no money, no family, no friends, no happiness.
          </p>

          <p>Most people in your situation would give up and accept their failures, thinking that their fate was destined for them not to be happy nor successful. However this wasn’t the case for Zeno of Citium. Being thrown in this unfortunate situation, Zeno decided to use his misfortunes as an opportunity to educate himself and restart his life. Studying the writings of Socrates, Zeno eventually started to amass students of his own. As his fame grew, his philosophy of Stoicism started to gain popularity. And thus, the story continues on from there. 
          </p>

          <p>We can learn a lot from the life and the lessons of Zeno. Applying Zeno’s simple ideologies to our everyday life can passively make us happier, paving the way for ultimate gratification and fulfilment in our lives.
          </p>

          <h2 style="font-family: 'Brygada 1918', serif;!important" class="section-heading">So What is Stoicism?</h2>

          <p>Initially going by the name “Zenoism'', Stoicism got its name from the Stoka Poikile, the name of the famous painted porch near the Athenian marketplace where Zeno would give his lecture to his students. 
          </p>

          <p>The Stoic philosophy started to gain traction in Rome. A notable student of the Stoic school of thought was the prominent Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius, who had embraced and further expanded upon the ideologies of the Stoic philosophy in his renowned treatise Meditations.
          </p>

          <p>Marcus Aurelius, among other Stoic practitioners, strongly advocated the philosophy’s ability of enlightening one on how to control their emotions. This article is going to simplify and condense the general themes of Stoic philosophy and explain how a simple application of its ideologies to your everyday life can make you happier.</p>

          <h2 style="font-family: 'Brygada 1918', serif;!important" class="section-heading">The General Philosophy of Stoicism
          </h2>

          <p>Stoicism was founded upon the the primarily ideology of self-awareness. The Stoic emphasized realizing the difference between circumstances which are under your control and those which are not, arguing that if a situation was/is not under your control then you should not let it affect your emotions.  
          </p>

         <p style="font-family:'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size: 1em;">Fate leads the willing, and drags along the reluctant.
          - Seneca, <i>Letters from a Stoic</i>
          </p>

          <p>The Stoics preach once you accept this fact of nature, that you cannot not control surrounding circumstances in your life, then you must embrace the fact that you control your emotions. The philosophy explains that an emotion is a voluntary reaction to a circumstance which affects you both mentally and physically. However, the Stoics do not preach a complete abolition of emotions, rather a method of converting negative emotions into positive ones.</p>  

          <p style="font-family:'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size: 1em;">Today I escaped from anxiety. Or no, I discarded it, because it was within me, in my own perceptions — not outside.
            - Marcus Aurelius, <i>Meditations</i>
          </p>

          <p>The Stoics highly advocate for acting upon logic, rather than letting emotion override your actions. In addition, the school promotes frequent mediating, suggesting that one should constantly be in dialogue with oneself, reflecting upon one’s reality, blessings and the contemplation of death. </p>

          <p style="font-family:'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size: 1em;">Take a lyre player: he’s relaxed when he performs alone, but put him in front of an audience, and it’s a different story, no matter how beautiful his voice or how well he plays the instrument. Why? Because he not only wants to perform well, he wants to be well received — and the latter lies outside his control.
            - Epictetus, <i>Enchiridion.</i>
          </p>
         <p>Furthermore, the Stoics preach that a simple method of finding happiness is through the relinquishment of material goods. Through practicing Asceticism (voluntary abstinence from material goods and worldly pleasures), one will finally observe the surrounding world clearly, finally allowing them to become present in the current moment. They explain that once you are able to find happiness without relying on material pleasures, you will be free from suffering, which the Stoics believe to be the ultimate goal of life.</p>
