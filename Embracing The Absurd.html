            The past year has acted as a shockwave for many people; whether you were compelled to stay inside your house by CDC and local governmental guidelines or you saw the COVID 19 pandemic as a farce, you were there to watch the numbers rise. The world watched the number of cases and deaths rise and fall, up and down. A time of downturn would arise, providing hope, only to spike up again. Until fairly recently certainty of what the future would look like was less than assured. What does all of this mean for you? What does this mean for the people around you? What does this mean for everyone? Although one may scramble to find a reason for this meaning, either a personal, political, or religious reason, it is hard to pinpoint any kind of reason for why the spreads of the Coronavirus pandemic and the consecutive crises occurred. The conclusion most would come to is probably that there is no inherent reason that can be drawn as to the occurrence of such unexpected and daunting events. Upon this realization, after experiencing a situation similar to that of last year, one can be left confused about what the meaning of their life is. Why does one continue living, completing daily tasks, go to work, go to school with a staunch ignorance about what a slowly reopening, post-COVID-19 world would have to offer? The inability to do such seemingly normative and menial activities leaves one without a reason. So, therefore, one searches. While this is not the only scenario in which one may attempt to search for a meaning in their life, it seems fair to assume that being stripped of one’s everyday activities and normal lifestyle would leave one questioning. Being stuck at home during the Coronavirus pandemic opened up the vault of such ideas. Continual sitting and wondering likely led to some form of contemplation of what their life means or what the meaning of life is. How does one, if disillusioned from common societally bolstered ideas surrounding the meaning of life, cope after coming to the conclusion that life on its own has no meaning? Such ideas are explored in depth by Albert Camus.

          <p style="text-indent: 2em; line-height: 2; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 1.1em;">Albert Camus was a twentieth century philosopher, writer, and journalist. Camus is generally described as an existentialist philosopher, rubbing shoulders with big names such as Sartre and De Bouvier as well as being inspired by the writing of Nietzche and Kierkegaard. Camus’ philosophy can be recognized by the label of “Absurdism.” The world, according to Camus, is absurd. He attempts to illustrate this absurdity through the conflict which arises from the search for a meaning of life by humans with the harsh truth that life holds no inherent meaning. Camus’ Absurdism, or any form of Existentialism for that matter, is often either conflated with or related to Nihilism. The comparisons are justified; many Existentialist philosophers were inspired by the works of Nihilists such as Nietzche. However, it is important to distinguish the difference between the two philosophical frameworks. While Nihilism and Existentialism both pose the idea that life has no inherent meaning, Existentialists often, Camus being an example, are able to provide a solution to such a dilemma. Putting such ideas into the context of the Coronavirus and the consistent situation of being housridden, stripped of one’s normal interactions and activities, could be helpful in understanding emotions felt during the time as well as serving as preparation for the potential of a future event similar to this.

          <p style="text-indent: 2em; line-height: 2; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 1.1em;">The recognition of such an issue, according to Camus, is the first step. The recognition of the absurdity of existence is necessary for dealing with such issues. During a global pandemic, this realization could’ve come in many ways. There isn’t one specific way in which one can identify the absurdity of reality. Situations in which this realization could occur vary on a person to person basis, at least it seems. Camus posits three solutions to the realization: suicide, philosophical suicide, and rebellion. The first, suicide, may seem bleak, and, in all honesty, it is. Camus claims that suicide means that one recognizes the absurdity of life, and in response, they are unable to survive such a confrontation. Therefore, one ends the suffering caused by this confliction through death. Although conclusive data about the effect on suicide rates the pandemic is somewhat unavaible right now, through inductive reasoning, it can be assumed that a time in which people are stripped of many portions of their normative life styles, mental health could be affected poorly. Camus’ second solution is philosophical suicide. One can commit philosophical suicide by adhering to a system of beliefs which provides a fictional answer to the bleak lack of reasoning existence inherently provides. A common example of philosophical suicide is the following of organized religion. If someone who follows organized religion attempted to find a reasoning for a situation such as the coronavirus pandemic, what conclusion would they come to? For the sake of appealing to Camus’ framework, they may be cured of the existential dread of meaninglessness, but it furthers the misunderstanding about death, looking towards something after it, something that simply does not exist.
          </p>

          <p style="text-indent: 2em; line-height: 2; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 1.1em;">Therefore, Camus comes to the conclusion that the best way to deal with the realization of the Absurd is through rebellion. Camus describes this rebellion not as a monumental battle or something of the like but rather a refusal without renunciation, a rebellion with an embracing. Camus promotes the maximization of one's experiences as a way of rebelling against the monotony and meaninglessness of existence. A prevalent figure of a character who goes about this process can be seen through the Greek mythological figure, Sisyphus. Sisyphus was a duplicitous king. When Zeus attempted to punish him for his actions, the man would slip away. After being caught, Sisyphus was banished to roll a boulder up a hill and watch it fall down for eternity. While Camus understands how dreary Sisyphus’ situation looks from the outside, he believes that one must “imagine Sisyphus happy.” Although this may not seem like a desirable fate, rolling the boulder up the hill gives meaning to Sisyphus’ life. Like the Absurd individual, Sisyphus rebels against the futility of life, finding meaning in this task. Being stripped of one’s everyday activities, a situation which occurred as a result of the spread of the Coronavirus pandemic, likely led many with a deficit of social interaction and purpose. If Camus’ framework is accurate, many people, during this time, came face to face with the Absurd nature of reality. The only true solution to such a problem is a rebellion against this absurdity, but what does that look like? Well that’s the thing. There cannot be one true solution. “Mean-making” must be carried out by the individual. It’s the responsibility of the Absurd individual to create this meaning. It is the responsibility of the Absurd individual to accept the unstoppable meaninglessness of existence while finding their own personal meaning through the process. However, what this looks like, broadly, is undefinable.
