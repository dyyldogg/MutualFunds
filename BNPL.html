            August 1st — when banking and payments giant, Square, announced that they were acquiring the Australian fintech Afterpay in a $29 billion transaction, it was more than business as usual in the heated tech M&A market. Square shares were trading at 50 times book value, leading them to be able to afford Afterpay, which maintains an impressive 16 million customers worldwide and profits growing at 96% each year. This purchase made headlines as a rare mega merger deal that makes sense on both sides of the company. Square is now able to offer merchants more purchase options as it expands with large global retailers, and for the consumer side, the company is able to integrate more credit and shopping volumes into their digital payment and banking services. The meaning of this deal goes far beyond the expansion of the competitive payments industry. Square’s transaction signified a new era in consumer behavior and credit usage: the upcoming Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) generation.

          <h2 style="font-family: 'Brygada 1918', serif;!important" class="section-heading">The BNPL Phenomenon 

          </h2>

          <p style="line-height: 2;">First, defining “Buy Now, Pay Later”: BNPL is simply the method by which a consumer can make a purchase at the point of sale (online or in store) and pay for it over time in pre-agreed installments without having to obtain a credit report. The financing is extended to the consumer, with shorter payback terms and without extra service fees or compounding interest. For example, Afterpay’s technology allows for users to immediately pay for goods in four, interest-free installments. 
          </p>

          <p style="line-height: 2;"><mark>BNPL not only enables the purchase of goods with the flexibility of payments, but it empowers consumers to manage their finances more efficiently.</mark>
          </p>

          
          <p style="line-height: 2;">Despite these trends, BNPL usage still remains low. With an estimated global opportunity of $10T in online payments projected by 2024, the BNPL market globally today is only approximately 2%. In the US, consumer and merchant adoption of BNPL is approximately 3%, in Europe, it’s slightly higher at 15%. However, merchants are shifting to multi-channel marketing and increasingly using BNPL to facilitate their customer acquisition. Since expected eCommerce spending is projected to average 20% yearly growth globally through 2024, the potential addressable market for BNPL within the payments industry is enormous.  
          </p>

          <h2 style="font-family: 'Brygada 1918', serif;!important" class="section-heading">A New Generation of Consumer Behavior

          </h2>

          <p style="line-height: 2;">Younger customers reflect the changes in purchasing preferences, as this new generation shows caution towards traditional credit use and banking relationships. Millennial and Gen Z consumers with growing spending power prefer more inclusive, flexible, and transparent ways to manage their finances. These consumers favor the increasing availability of financing without reporting to a credit bureau, and prefer flexible payment schedules with no compounded interest. 
          </p>

          <p style="line-height: 2;">With BNPL, the consumer makes an immediate judgement of what they can afford, and whether they should buy something outside their budget or not. When breaking large purchases into smaller payments, buyers trick themselves into feeling more responsible. Consumers make their contracted payments on their installment loans though cash accounts (like Afterpay’s cash app or Paypal’s wallet) as opposed to determining what they can afford on payments to a traditional credit card. BNPL affirms that this next generation of consumers is transitioning from a credit to a debit world — which is beneficial for decreasing market risks and individual indebtedness.</p>

          <p style="line-height: 2;">All in all, the opportunities for BNPL are game changing: whether this means accelerating the recovery of economic activity in the retail sector, or forever altering consumer behavior and freedom. </p>


          <!-- <h2 style="font-family: 'Brygada 1918', serif;!important" class="section-heading">How Long Does Hypnotherapy Take?
          </h2>
          <p style="line-height: 2;">How many sessions it takes to achieve a goal is highly dependent on how dedicated the client is. Therefore, many hypnotherapists don’t take clients that aren't completely interested in and dedicated to results. It normally takes 1-6 sessions to work on a specific thing <i>(depending on the scope of the issue)</i>. Most sessions take about an hour, but some clients may choose to go really deep and spend two or three hours exploring their issue and creating change
          </p>

          <h2 style="font-family: 'Brygada 1918', serif;!important" class="section-heading">How is Hypnotherapy Different From Traditional Therapy?
          </h2>
          <p style="line-height: 2;">he major difference is that hypnotherapy is solution-based, whereas traditional therapy is problem-based. In traditional therapy, patients are often encouraged to talk about their problems and "get it all out." Unfortunately, that approach takes a long time, is usually ineffective, and only works for some people. In hypnotherapy, with the help of Neuro-Linguistic Programming, the therapist and client focus on the structure of the problem, how the client thinks about it, and how to change their thinking/the structure to make the problem easily solvable. Unlike a traditional therapist, hypnotherapists are not there to "fix" you. Their goal is to teach you to help yourself. They are no more than a guide or a practitioner.

          <!-- <h2 style="font-family: 'Brygada 1918', serif;!important" class="section-heading">What is NLP <i>(Neuro-Linguistic Programming)</i> Coaching?
          </h2>

          <p style="line-height: 2;">Many hypnotherapists are also trained and certified in NLP because of how well it plays into the healing and growth process of hypnotherapy. Coaching is a process of helping people strengthen their ability to achieve their goals and change their life. A NLP Coach guides people toward discovering what changes they want to make and how to make them. What makes a NLP Coach different from a traditional coach is that a traditional coach works with the conscious mind and an NLP Coach works with the conscious mind, unconscious mind, and model of the world. That's because we believe clients already have all the resources they need inside them and it's not our job to make them know or see things the way we do. The reason it is so important to bring in the unconscious mind is the difference between just deciding what you want to do (working with your conscious) and actually doing it (working with your unconscious). Gaining insight into and control over your internal, mental, and emotional processes is the greatest development one can make.
