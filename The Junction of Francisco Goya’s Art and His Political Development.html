            Francisco Goya. Although this name may not be familiar to the average person,
            numerous of his paintings are likely to be recognized by any individual who has even a passing
            awareness of art history. Goya is acclaimed as one of the most influential and important artists
            due to his influence on a variety of painters throughout the 19th and 20th centuries including
            Picasso, Manet, Degas, etc. While Goya’s art alone is experienced as visually pleasurable or
            “good” to most people who see it, an interesting aspect of influence on Goya’s work is
            introduced when discussing the socio-political climate in which Goya came to develop his art.
            Coming of age during a period of massive philosophical growth and development, Goya would
            go on to provide a sharp, caricaturistic exemplification of the contradictions which plagued
            Spanish society from the late 18th to the early 19th century. Along with this clear rapport
            between Goya’s political beliefs and art, a significant development in his faith in and hope for
            authentic political change is equally as clear. The stylistic and tonal shifts within Goya’s work
            reveals the development of a seemingly hopeful, pro-Enlightenment liberal Spaniard into a
            politically faithless, decrepit husk of his former self. The result could be perceived as politically
            resentful or hopeless; this development can ostensibly be attributed to the continual failure of
            Enlightenment ideals to gain socially and politically significant traction during Goya’s lifetime
          </p>


          <p style="text-indent: 2em; line-height: 2; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 1.1em;">Goya’s political beliefs can be revealed through various circumstances. For example,
            according to various sources, Goya was adamantly against various dogmatic practices of the
            church. Particularly, Goya took issue with the behavior of the Spanish Inquisition and the
            church's complicity . Along with this, Goya seemed to hold a militancy which favored working
            people. He was noted to have opposed exploitation of farm workers and tradesmen, likely in
            adherence to newly circulated Enlightenment values like individual rights. In continual support
            of said ideas, or rather the incremental addition of them into Spanish society, Goya and many
            other politically hopeful people supported the rule of King Charles III. In 1789, Goya became a
            painter for Charles III. Charles, despite growing his absolute rule by centralizing more power
            into the crown, was very popular amongst the populace. This popularity could be attributed to
            the comparative prosperity and continual implementation of Enlightenment ideals into policy
            passed under his kingship. Although he tightened control over local governments, Charles III
            would lead Spain into a massive economic and cultural revival by dropping commercial
            restrictions on trade and opening up ports and commerce to all subjects within the Spanish
            kingdom, a decision which helped to notably grow the Spanish economy. During this period of
            time, many proponents of Enlightenment thoughts, such as Goya, felt extremely emboldened.
            The ideals which they had been hoping for seemed to be finally coming into fruition. Charles
            III’s rule, for many of these individuals, looked like the first step in the direction to the
            materialization of Enlightenment concepts in Spanish reality. However, this sentiment would
            quickly be squashed with the death of Charles III as well as the performance of his successor.

          <p style="text-indent: 2em; line-height: 2; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 1.1em;">As referenced prior, the death of Charles III would lead Spain down a comparatively
            regressive path. Charles IV, Charles III’s successor, ostensibly pushed Goya’s down this
            continual path of disillusionment as exemplified through his art during this period, art which
            conveyed a strong and rationalizing view of Spanish society. Under the rule of Charles IV, Goya
            became one of the most recognized painters within Spain, being granted the position of first
            court painter in 1799. Goya’s work of the time, despite his position, offered a stark, rational, and
            piercingly critical portrayal of the royalty which had presided over continual social and political
            regression. A clear example can be seen through Goya’s piece titled <i>Charles IV of Spain and His
            Family</i>, painted in 1800. This painting is often referenced when discussing the political
            frustration Goya felt during Charles IV’s rule in Spain. In addition to the political regression
            overseen by the figure, Charles’ family was accused of incestuous and adulterous action during
            Charles’ reign. The context given to this painting, including Goya’s clear anger towards the
            regression away from policy informed by Enlightenment thought, has led many to believe that
            the painting was a satirical depiction of the family. The awkward arrangement of individual
            canvas along with Goya’s glaring depiction of himself in the corner of the painting could
            possibly indicate the satirical nature of it. Goya’s awkward depiction in <i>Charles IV and His
            Family</i> seems purposeful when other work of his from this period is viewed. This awkwardness
            brings up a questioning of what the motive of the stylistic decision was, as it was not a clear
            thematic or stylistic continuity within his art during the time. However, it should be noted that
            there is a significant uncertainty surrounding this interpretation of the piece. As art critic Robert
            Hughes pointed out, “[y]ou didn’t manage to keep your job as an official court portraitist if you
            were satirising the people you were painting.”
          </p>

          <p style="text-indent: 2em; line-height: 2; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 1.1em;">Another prominent example of Goya’s growing political disillusionment can be seen
            through his works titled <i>The Madhouse</i> and <i>Los Caprichos</i>. <i>The Madhouse</i> denotes a specific
            change in the kind of artwork Goya was producing, a notion of the beginning of his discontent
            with the continual lack of political development and stagnancy within Spain.<i>The Madhouse</i>
            specifically identifies a distaste for the treatment of individuals within mental asylums. This was
            inspired by Goya’s visit to the Zaragoza mental asylum. This main shift in Goya’s style is
            somewhat of a form of exaggerated realism, almost caricature. <i>Los Caprichos</i> helps to further
            emphasize the upset Goya felt in reference to the socio-political state of Spain during this point
            of his life. Within the collection of eighty etchings, Goya attacked various religious and political
            abuses he identified through his piercingly critical view of the world. Goya created a dramatic
            and fantastical depiction of what he called the “extravagances and folies common to all society.”
            Funnily enough, many of the etchings were such clear references to well known figures within
            his society that they had to be withdrawn from sale shortly after their release.            
          </p>
          <p style="text-indent: 2em; line-height: 2; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 1.1em;">In 1808, Charles IV was forced to abdicate the throne as Napoleon's army entered Spain.
            Napoleon’s brother became the new king. Goya’s reaction to the political destruction of the
            period can be seen through the series of etchings known as <i>The Disasters of War</i>. These etching
            made it clear that the tonal shift in Goya’s work exemplified through <i>Los Caprichos</i> and <i>The
            Madhouse</i> were not some tangential or momentary shift in his work. The fervently discontented
            and almost satirical nature Goya had developed prior is nowhere to be found in these desolate
            works. The set of etching Goya composed during this period of bloodshed and unrest illustrate an
            extremely bleak, realistic, and brutal portrayal of the French invasion of Spain. Goya’s dismay
            continued into the rule of Ferdinand VII, the son of Charles the IV who was placed into power in
            1814. This dismay was made clear by Goya’s unscrupulous depiction of Ferdinand as the cruel
            and despicable tyrant which he was. During his reign, Ferdinand drove many of Goya’s friends
            out of the country and into exile. Goya’s recognition of the absurd reality of a society which once
            seemed like it was moving towards the Enlightenment goals popularized earlier in his life drove
            him to willingly enter exile in 1824.
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 2em; line-height: 2; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 1.1em;">Goya’s austere and critical eye continued as his exile from Spain began. It was during this
              time period that Goya created art which would go on to be extremely acclaimed despite the fact
              that he may have never intended the public to see. Goya, during this latter period of his life,
              would paint murals throughout the house which he was confined to as his health continued to
              falter. Said paintings would eventually become known colloquially as the “black paintings.”
              Although the desolate and bleak nature of these paintings was likely influenced by Goya’s
              continually decreasing quality of health, it is fair to assume that his life-long political
              disillusionment played a role in the creation of these various paintings. In Goya’s <i>Saturn
              Devouring His Son</i>, he gruesomely depicts the titan named Kronos eating one of his children.
              The scene depicted is immensely gruesome. The original story tells of how this titan would eat
              his children out of fear of them overthrowing him. However, Goya’s depiction is considerably
              more gruesome and visually obscured than any prior depiction. While the meaning of said
              painting is up to interpretation, it exemplifies this deeply enigmatic yet dreary nature of Goya’s
              art as he neared death. Similarly, paintings scavenged after his death like <i>A Pilgrimage to San
              Isidro and Witches’ Sabbath</i> continue this theme, helping to cement the clear disillusioned,
              dreary, and hopelessness of Goya perceived through the art he created towards the end of his life.</p>
                            
              <p style="text-indent: 2em; line-height: 2; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 1.1em;">Throughout his life, Francisco Goya was a strong proponent of pro-Enlightenment,
                philosophically liberal ideals, and he’d spend his life hoping for the ushering in of said ideas into
                Spanish society. Despite this, he was met with staunch political inauthenticity and very little
                palpable change. The tonal and stylistic shifts of Goya’s artwork throughout his life help to
                create a timeline of a continually dwindling hope and political disillusionment</p>
